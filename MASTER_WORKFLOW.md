## 🎯 Recommended Execution Strategy

### Strategy A: Sequential Development (Safer, More Predictable)
Execute backend first, then frontend for each phase. Recommended for single developer or small team.

**Execution Order:**
1. Backend Phase 1 → Frontend Phase 1
2. Backend Phase 2 → Frontend Phase 2
3. Backend Phase 3 → Frontend Phase 3
4. And so on...

**Advantages:**
- Clear API contracts before frontend development
- Can test APIs with tools like Postman before UI
- Reduces integration issues
- Easier debugging

**Timeline Estimation:**
- ~85-100 credits total
- ~2-3 months for full implementation (assuming 1 phase per week)

---

### Strategy B: Parallel Development (Faster, Requires Coordination)
Work on backend and frontend simultaneously with careful planning.

**Parallel Phases:**
- **Sprint 1**: Backend Phase 1 + Frontend Phase 1 (Authentication)
- **Sprint 2**: Backend Phase 2 + Frontend Phase 2 (Profiles & Dashboard)
- **Sprint 3**: Backend Phase 3 + Frontend Phase 3 (Jobs & Directory)
- **Sprint 4**: Backend Phase 4 + Frontend Phase 4 (Mentorship)
- **Sprint 5**: Backend Phase 5 + Frontend Phase 5 (Events & Community)
- **Sprint 6**: Backend Phase 6 + Frontend Phase 7 (Notifications)
- **Sprint 7**: Backend Phase 7 + Frontend Phase 8 (Admin & Analytics)
- **Sprint 8**: Backend Phase 8 + Frontend Phase 9 (Smart Features & Visualizations)
- **Sprint 9**: Backend Phase 9 + Integration Testing
- **Sprint 10**: Backend Phase 10 + Frontend Phase 10 (Polish & Optimization)

**Requirements:**
- Agree on API contracts before starting
- Use mock data in frontend initially
- Regular integration checkpoints
- Two developers or alternating focus

**Timeline Estimation:**
- Can reduce to ~6-8 weeks with proper coordination
- Higher initial complexity but faster overall
